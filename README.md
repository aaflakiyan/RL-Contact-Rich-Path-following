# RL-Contact-Rich-Path-following
This repository showcases the use of a simulated cutter on a KUKA robot, coupled with vision, to instruct a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent in following a contact-rich path across various surfaces (The Ros package and gazebo simulation part is not included).

The environment of interest should be cloned, and ROS Topics and ROS services and functionalities should be updated respectively in all the files. 

##TO DO
The example simulation environemnt will be added.
